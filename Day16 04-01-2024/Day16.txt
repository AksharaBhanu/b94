method
1. reusable block of statements with a specific name
2. saves time,space, reusable and easy maintanance
3. to execute method we must call it
4. we can call a method any number of times
5. in java main method is always the starting point
6. we call a method inside method 
7. But we cant write a method inside other method
8. in java we have 2 types of methods
   a. static method--> called using class name
   b. non-static method--> called using object/ref variable
9. we can call any method from any other method - we should ensure that there is no infite loop
10. a method can call itself - recursive method
11.while calling the method number of arg & data type should match

12. void--> this method will not return any value
13.  if the return type is void we should write empty return statement--> return;
14.  if we dont write empty return statement, compiler writes it
15. if the return type is other than void then it is mandatory to write return statement
16. we can not write any code after return statement inside the same block
17. we can not return multiple values at a time - we can use array or collection
