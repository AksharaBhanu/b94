a variable can hold only one value (recent) at a time
Array --> collection of elements (data) or group of data
in java Array is non-primitive data type

we can use .length --> property present in Array which will help us to count the number of elements present in the array -size of the array

if arry size is n then index will be 0 to n-1
if we specify any other index we get ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

. (DOT) access operator used to access member of the class or object

in java array is homogeneous
we cant store diff types of data under a same array in java
(in java array is NOT heterogeneous)

in java once we create array we cant change its size

in java array size is fixed

we can use for each loop to iterate through array elements
for(datatype var:array)
{
	//loop body
}

faster compared to for i
no need to use counter --> i
no need to check the condion
no need to update i++ i-- XXXX

limitations of for each loop
1. for each works with only array/collection it cant be used for general purpse (1 to 100, check if number is prime or not print triangle...)

2. in for each we can't skip the elements

3. in for each we cant access array elements in reverse order

4. we can only read from the array , we cant write into array


when we create an empty array , java will store default values in its cells

byte short int long-->0
float double--> 0.0
boolean-->false
char--> 1 space  --> ' '
everything else --> null
